You will have the list of all the images of the CMS. You can search for the image you want to edit. Open the image, then click on the icon present below to the right of the image when you position the mouse over the image.

By clicking on this icon, you can upload a new image. Please note that there will be no confirmation message. Once the image is uploaded, it will replace the existing image.

!!!warning
- You must ensure that the new image has the same format as the image you want to replace. Ex: If the image was in **png** format, the new image must also be in **png** format.
- Once an element has been modified, you cannot return to the form as it was before the modification. So be careful before saving.
